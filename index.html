      A traditional Sanskrit theatrical dance from Kerala, performed with elaborate facial expressions and storytelling through mudras.
    </dd>

    <dt>Garba Fusion</dt>
    <dd>
      A modern blend of Garba with western choreography seen during Navratri festivals in urban India.
    </dd>

    <dt>Baiga Tribal Movement</dt>
    <dd>
      A rhythmic, grounded dance by the Baiga tribe of Madhya Pradesh, originally performed around harvest season to invoke nature spirits.
    </dd>
  </dl>
